Yeah, people, attention
Education, knowledge
Huh, yeah, I got something to
say to my teachers
Genius is not the answer to all
questions
It's the question to all answers
Do we learn math to add the dead
sums?
Subtract the weak ones, count
cash for great ones?
Yo, we multiply but divide the
nation.
Break down like fractions, send
our sons away to die
Do we learn science in defiance
of faith?
To make alliance with fakes for
an appliance's sake?
We ask for the real to make
artificial intelligence to make
smarter kills of others'
presidents
Why do we learn history? To fix
stories for the guilty
Make angels look filthy and the
devils look milky
If the victor writes the books
then what have we won?
Are we battleships of authorship
a rich man's guns?
Do we learn to read to receive
the lies,
to deceive the eyes from seeing
between the lines?
Yo, we use words to bring forth
sticks and stones,
to sing songs of hate that fill
the streets with bones.
Unseen or heard,
a king with words
Tablo, lyrical assassin
y-y-yeah yeah
Make me vision for better livin'
Unseen or heard,
a king with words
Tablo, lyrical assassin
y-y-yeah yeah
Make me vision
(I'm the truth)
Is a day job more than
self-slavery?
When we're locked watching the
clock impatiently
we sweat for the dollar bills,
the checks, and the credit cards
but the dollar kills, breaks the
necks of our inner hearts
If the police are role models
for the righteous,
why does justice depend on guns
and nightsticks?
Mr. officer, don't punish me,
with brutality
The streets got me singing
Marvin Gaye off-key
Why do we need church to get to
heaven's gates?
Can holy water quench the thirst
of those whose fates
Started in the wrong place with
the wrong face?
Can the poor and the hungry
survive solely on grace?
Can this rap game ever bring
changes?
When MCs would rather floss a
cross than be saviors?
Will I last in this game, be
blasted with shame
Will I stand for my name and
never blaspheme for fame?
Unseen or heard,
a king with words
Tablo, lyrical assassin
y-y-yeah yeah
Make me vision for better livin'
Unseen or heard,
a king with words
Tablo, lyrical assassin
y-y-yeah yeah
Make me vision
(I'm the truth)
